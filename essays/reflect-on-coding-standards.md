**Coding standards can enhance the person's ability to focus on the language itself rather than on how the code looks.** It allows the person to write readable code straight from the start. Not only does it make the code look nice but good coding standards can make it easier to spot errors and bugs. Also coding standards are great when working as a team because it makes it easier to read each other's code. So I somewhat agree that coding standards do help with the learning of a programming language. However coding standards can be misused by the person implementing them which can cause friction in a team.

**You should develop your own personal coding standards but also be open to following other coding standards as well.** After the first week of using eslint with intellij I found myself annoyed by all the red error lines. Some of the programmings exercises took me longer because I had to fix my errors in order to get that green check mark. There are certain things in the code styling that I have to get used to. Like having spaces after my variable declarations. Everything feels so cramped up. It will  take me a while to get used to it. After that short rant, I do believe that having coding standards is very beneficial to you as a programmer, especially if you are working as team.
