**As a Math and Computer Science major, Math will always be number 1.** However, I really enjoy technology, and Software Engineering allows you to explore and learn about old and new technology. There’s a lot of freedom in what you can do or how you can use technology to build something meaningful. Also I’m interested in being able to design and develop software that is useful for everyone.

**Since I am also a Math major, I am very interested in the application of mathematical analysis of Software Engineering.** One big interest is being able to use my love of Math to solve problems. Good problem solving skills is important in any field of work or study, especially when it comes to research and development. Another interest I have in Software Engineering is the collaboration with others on projects. Collaboration is important because it allows you to pool your resources together in order to accomplish a task.

**Software Engineering is a very flexible and open field.** You must have a wide variety of skills and you must always be open to new experiences to be successful. I would really like develop my research skills because poor research can cause poor planning, and poor planning can cause poor everything. Also I would like to develop my communication skills because communication is extremely important when it comes to teamwork.
