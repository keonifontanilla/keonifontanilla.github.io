**As a complete newbie and having learned C, C++, and Java first**, I would have to say that Javascript is sort of similar to Java. Javascript was not too hard to pick up since the logic is generally the same as other programming languages. Once I started doing the exercises it felt very natural and easy to get in to. One thing that I think is pretty neat is how Javascript deals with objects. Using Objects in Javascript seems fairly simple, but can get confusing when dealing with nested objects and arrays.

**I think learning Javascript is very important no matter what tech or computer field you are in.** From a software engineering perspective knowing Javascript is very valuable. As a software engineer you might be working on a lot of web projects and web applications where Javascript is necessary. So in my opinion Javascript is a good programming language for any software engineer.

**Athletic software engineering at first seems like a weird way to approach software engineering.** The “Workout of the Day” (WOD) seem very stressful at first because of the time limit and the pressure of not being the last one in the room trying to finish. So at first it may take you longer to focus on the task. However, I do see the benefits of this approach because the more we practice the WODs, the more it becomes second nature. So I believe that this will work for me and anyone else that puts in the effort into completing the WODs on time.
