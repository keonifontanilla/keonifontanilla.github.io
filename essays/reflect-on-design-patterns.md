	**Imagine starting a large software related project.** After a certain point in development you  look at the work you have done and you tell yourself, "maybe I should have done this differently" or "there's probably a better way to do this." If only there was some sort of template to guide you towards a better solution. Well that's what design patterns are for. A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design. Design patterns address the questions about the structure of your software and what approaches you might take to handle certain problems with each approach having advantages and disadvantages. 
	
    **There are many problems that pop up repeatly and what design you use to deal with them is very important.** There are several advantages for using design patterns. One main advantages is speeding up the development because the design you are using have already been shown to work. Another advantage is communication between developers especially if you are working as a team, eveyone will know how to approach a problem and what the solution will look like. Although I have not been programming for a long time. I have used serveral design patterns in homeworks, exercises and projects. For javascript I have been using the protype design pattern to build new instances from other instances. Also for React/Meteor I have been using the observer design pattern to deal with subscriptions and publications in Meteor. This is very important for how data flows and communicates in Meteor.
