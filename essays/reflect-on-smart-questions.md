Asking smart questions are important for software engineers because it helps us learn and understand the problem better. It will help others that are searching for the same or similar problem too. By going though the steps to make sure that you have done everything you can to fix your problem, you make it easier for people responding to your question to provide a meaningful fix or pointer. For example by searching the web or going to a forum and searching for similar problems, you might actually find what you are looking for without having to ask a question that has been asked several times before. Also doing actual work and trying everything you can to fix the problem is better than straight up asking for help because it shows you are doing the research and not just lazily asking for the answer. So asking smart questions allows the person answering the question to be more responsive and they will provide better feedback.	

After going through several posts on stack exchange, I’ve noticed that questions that are bad usually have negative votes, very little replies and a lot of views. In one bad post that stood out the subject header was not very specific and the user posted a bunch of data with no actual question in the body of the post. In fact the few people that did respond were asking questions so the user can give more information. It was clear that no actual research or experimentation was done. On the other hand a good post that I had stumbled across had a short and specific header and had many replies. The user had posted a snippet of code and was precise and informative about the problem. Methods on what was done and what works and doesn’t work were posted. There were several really good replies and the solution to the problem was found fairly quickly. 

I must admit that there were times where I threw a question together quickly and posted it online on some forum hoping to get a meaningful answer. Often times I’ve did get an answer but most of those answers were pointing to another similar problem or asking me to be more clear. I’ve learned that in order to receive a more meaningful response to a question you must put in the effort to make sure the question is clear. You have to do the research, be clear on what the goal is, describe the steps you took to get to the problem, show thanks, and be polite. Smart questions not only make you smarter but also others that have the same problem and even the person answering the question.
