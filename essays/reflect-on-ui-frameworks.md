**UI frameworks are great!** The use of a framework allows you to make very nice, clean and symmetrical web layouts. A good framework comes with good documentation making it easy to quickly find what you need for your own site. However UI frameworks are definitely not simple, especially if you are just starting out with CSS. Which is why using a framework with good documentation  is  very important. 

**Semantic UI is a very good framework.** Learning pure CSS can be very difficult at first. So why bother with Sematic UI if CSS is hard? Well a framework like Semantic UI helps with the learning process. It teaches you good habits and teaches you how different pieces of a site fit nicely together. Class names are very descriptive of what it does making it easy to find out what you want to use. So in return for investing time and frustration in using a framework like Semantic UI, you get nice looking websites and a greater understanding of HTML and CSS. 

**Using raw HTML and CSS is very important.** I believe that having a good understanding of CSS and HTML makes understanding a framework much easier. Having used Semantic UI for the past week I was surprised about how fast I could make a somewhat nice looking site. However when it came to adding my own CSS to the site, it took me much longer to get the pieces to fit nicely. So having a good understanding in pure CSS you are able to make changes to different components of the framework and tweak it to your liking. For software engineers a huge benefit for learning a framework is efficiency. Building nice things faster saves time and money.
