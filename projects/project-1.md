[UHire](https://uhire.github.io/) is a web app created by me and four others. It was created for ICS 314 Software Engineering class in the spring semester of 2019. UHire is a mock website designed so company can easily post job opportunities for students that attend the University of Hawaii.

Students are able to register an account and create their personal profile. They are asked to fill out their information and interests. Students can browse companies and apply for positions that the companies post up. Their profiles will appear on the browse students page so companies can view them and see what their interests are.
